/**
 * # `regex.h`
 *
 * This is a regular expression evaluator based on code from the article
 * "Regular Expressions: Languages, algorithms, and software"
 * By Brian W. Kernighan and Rob Pike in the April 1999 issue of
 * Dr. Dobb's Journal
 *
 * I've found the article online at
 * <http://www.ddj.com/dept/architect/184410904>
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * * `rx_match()` is used to match text to a pattern.
 * * `rx_search()` is used to find the position of text matching a pattern
 *  for further processing.
 * * `rx_sub()` is used to substitute a piece of text matching a regex with
 *    some other text.
 * * `rx_gsub()` is used to substitute all pieces of the text matching a regex
 *    with some other text.
 *
 * ## Syntax
 * The evaluator implements only a subset of the usual regular expression
 * language.
 *
 * * The `'*'`, `'+'` and `'?'` operators
 * * Character sets `'[abc]'` with ranges (`'[a-c]'`) and inversion (`'[!abc]'`)
 *     To match a `'-'` in the character set, place it before the closing `']'`,
 *     like `'[abcde-]'`
 * * Special characters can be escaped using the characters '\'
 * * Additionally, a '\' can be used for specific character classes:
 *   * `\a` - Alphabetic characters: `[a-zA-Z]`
 *   * `\w` - Word characters: `[a-zA-Z0-9]`
 *   * `\d` - Digits: `[0-9]`
 *   * `\u` - Uppercase characters: `[A-Z]`
 *   * `\l` - Lowercase characters: `[a-z]`
 *   * `\x` - Hexadecimal digits: `[0-9a-fA-F]`
 *   * `\s` - Whitespace characters
 *   * Upper case versions of these are used to negate the class. For example,
 *     `\A` matches anything that is not an alphabetic character: `[!a-zA-Z]`
 * * Case-insensitive matching is enabled with `'\i'` and disabled with `'\I'`
 *
 * The tradeoff is a very compact implementation.
 *
 * To use this module in your program, you can include "regex.h" at the top,
 * and link against the compiled objact file.
 *
 * Features not supported, but found in other regex engines:
 *
 * * Alternation `|`
 * * Grouping and submatch extraction `(abc)`
 * * The `{m,n}` operator
