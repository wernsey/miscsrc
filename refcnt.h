/**
 * # `refcnt.h`
 *  Reference counter for C.
 *
 * * Objects are allocated with `rc_alloc()` which returns a reference counted
 *   block of memory. The initial reference count is set to one.
 * * Use `rc_set_dtor()` to register a destructor function on an object that
 *   gets called when the object is reclaimed. This destructor can be used to
 *   release references to other objects which the object being released may hold.
 * * `rc_release()` decrements an object's reference count. If it becomes 0
 *   the object's destructor is called and the object is free()'d.
 * * Use `rc_retain()` to increment an object's reference count.
 *
 * ## Debug mode
 *
 * The reference counter contains some additional features to track where memory
 * is allocated, retained and released if compiled with `NDEBUG` not defined.
 *
 * This can help to troubleshoot potential memory leaks where not all objects are released.
 *
 * It adds some overhead, so it is disabled if `NDEBUG` is defined for release
 * mode builds.
 *
 * Call `rc_init()` at the start of your program to register a function with
 * `atexit()` that will print all unreleased objects and their usages to
 * `stdout` when the program terminates.
