/*
 *	A Ratcliff-Obershelp style string matcher.
 *
 *	The Ratcliff-Obershelp algorithm was presented in Dr Dobbs' Journal in
 *	the article "Pattern Matching: The Gestalt Approach" by John W. Ratcliff
 *	and David E. Metzener in July 1988.
 *	  Unfortunately the original implementation was in assembly, limiting its
 *	portability and readability, and its relevance to modern architectures
 *	(although its performance was extremely optimized).
 *	  In Nov 1988 Joe Preston sent a C implementation of the algorithm to
 *	Dr. Dobbs' letters to the editor. The C implementation used a recursive
 *	algorithm. Unfortunately, according to the author it ran about twice as slow
 *	as the original. My implementation is inspired by that C implementation.
 *
 * 	The algorithm returns a value between 0 and 100 which indicates how alike
 *	two strings are. 0 means the strings have nothing in common, and 100 means
 *	they're exactly alike.
 *
 *	The typical use of the algorithm is for validating user input. The original
 *	article described educational software that can deal with spelling errors in
 *	answers. Other uses are applications that could supply a user with feedback
 *	along the lines of "The command 'fobo' is invalid. Did you mean 'foo'?" or
 *	intelligent compilers that could make suggestions when identifiers or
 *	keywords are used incorrectly.
 *
 * This is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.
