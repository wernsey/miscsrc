A library of miscellaneous C functions I've written over time.

The modules include:

 * A JSON parser and serializer
 * A set of functions to read, write and manipulate __Comma Separated Values__ (CSV) files,
 * A parser for __INI__ configuration files,
 * A mathematical expression evaluator,
 * A mark-and-sweep garbage collector,
 * A reference counting garbage collector,
 * A simple regular expression pattern matcher,
 * A generic linked list implementation with extra helper functions,
 * A simple hash table implementation,
 * A function that compares the _similarity_ of two strings,
 * An alternative to `getopt()` called `getarg()` for platforms without _getopt()_ (meant for WIN32) and
 * A couple of utility functions.

It is a collection of C code that I've implemented over the course of several years
and used, tested and reused in several of my hobby projects.
