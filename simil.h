 * The return value is a value between 0 and 100 where 0 means that
 * the two strings have nothing in common, and 100 means that they're exact

/**
 * #### `int isimil (const char *a, const char *b)`
 * Tests the case-insensitive similarity of two strings a and b using
 * the Ratcliff-Obershelp method.
 *
 * It copies the strings internally using `strdup()`, converts the copies
 * to uppercase, and compares those.
 *
 * The return value is a value between 0 and 100 where 0 means that
 * the two strings have nothing in common, and 100 means that they're exact
 * matches. It may also return zero if the calls to `strdup()` fail.
